I took it the same semester when I took Real Analysis, although it may be advisable to take Real Analysis first.\nBoth subjects  demand a lot of time.  A good understanding of topology is essential for future courses. Wilman has always put emphasis on how important this subject is, and now that I’m in my last year, I can confirm that it is indeed the case.</p>\n<p>This is an introductory course to topology or, better said, to what is called point set topology or general topology. You will not see classical topological objects like the Klein bottle. A deeper study of topology is Algebraic Topology. Munkres does cover this subject from chapter 9 onwards. Last time Wilman took a <em>metric spaces first</em> approach to the course. He will probably do the same next semester, so keep this in mind if you want to study ahead.</p>\n<p>I learned topology mainly using <a href=\"https://www.math.toronto.edu/ivan/mat327/?resources\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this lecture notes</a> from the University of Toronto for the course <em>MAT327 • Topology</em>, which  has a lot of material already.

It is not aimed at undergraduate level though. However, it is an invaluable reference. The author leaves a lot of details to the reader, but provides concise and very clean proofs.  Actually, I used it as a reference for Functional Analysis (check chapter 6, especially the section  _Consequences of Baire's Theorem_), Probability Theory (the last chapter is devoted presents a gentle introduction) and even when I had to review some stuff on the Cantor Set (an intricate set with a lot of topological properties, see section 2D).\n- Professor Brito's _Aromas de una misma escencia_: it was a great reference, especially because he taught the course.

Studying ahead is a very good idea.</p>\n<p>This is an introductory course to Abstract Algebra also called Modern Algebra. (When a mathematician talks about <em>algebra</em> it refers to this subject, not to linear algebra or the algebra you learn in high school.)  This subject is not like the other ones of this list. Let’s say <a href=\"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82343131.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">the <em>modus operandi</em> is different</a>: you develop a new way of thinking. In a way, you cannot  apply the heuristics used for Analysis.  As Cesc would say, <em>think a lot and write very little</em>. The course is not difficult, but one has to solve as many exercises as possible. I enjoyed it very much. On the other hand, I’d say that skills on proofs and writing are necessary to take this course. Be open minded to learn a new and beautiful part of mathematics.</p>\n<p>Some resources you may want to review are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Past quices &#x26; exams</strong>: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FTMpJNasKzT90oIHA8NvtYr9XO-bDXQt?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Assignments, problem sets, lecture notes</strong>: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Un0hj7hUM3ngxt2WoRxDdaAGTV5xZXOG?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Book</strong>: Abstract Algebra by Dummit &#x26; Foote.

Basically, here we study vector spaces (and the maps between them) but in infinite dimensions. The main part of the course consist of the Fundamental Theorems of Functional Analysis. (Yes, they have  a special name.) It turns out these theorems are consequences of Baire’s Theorem, a result of general topology. (Topology again!)

It is available in Yachay’s library.</li>\n<li>Functional Analysis, Sobolev Spaces and Partial Differential Equations by Haim Brezis. This is a classic and very popular book, but  it is not  an introductory textbook. Use it  as a reference. It starts straight with the Hahn Banach Theorem.</li>\n<li>Elements of the Theory of Functions and Functional Analysis by Kolmogorov &#x26; Fomin. It goes very fast. I only used to compare results and proofs.</li>\n<li>Handbook of Analysis and its Foundations by Eric Schechter.
